# ngrx workspace

This repository now contains an Angular workspace (`ngrx-playground`) that is preconfigured with NgRx dependencies so you can immediately begin practicing with actions, reducers, effects, and selectors.

Navigate into the project and install dependencies to get started:

```bash
cd ngrx-playground
npm install
npm start
```
